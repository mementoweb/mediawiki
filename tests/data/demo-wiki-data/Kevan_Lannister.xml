      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1473">'''Kevan Lannister''' was [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother and most trusted captain. He is known for his reliability and loyalty. Kevan recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age and was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. It is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin hadn't had first. He is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], Willem and Martyn, and a daughter, Janei. 

After Tywin's death, [[Cersei Lannister]] offered him the position of [[Hand of the King]], but he refused because Cersei would not agree to return to [[Casterly Rock]]. He quickly became alienated to his immediate family. He believed [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be a murderer and came to believe the rumors of incest about Cersei and Jaime. His eldest son, Lancel, became a religious fanatic and abandoned the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan was also angered that [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] received the title of Warden of the West over him, and refused to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returned to the west to see his younger son Martyn. After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[Small Council]] named him Regent of the King. It is unknown as of yet whether he will accept the position.

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' is [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. He served for years as Tywin's most trusted captain. He is known for his reliability and loyalty. Kevan recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age and was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. It is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin hadn't had first.   

==Recent Events==
===A Game of Thrones===
Ser Kevan is with the army under [[Tywin Lannister]]'s command in [[the Riverlands]].

===A Storm of Swords===
Ser Kevan attended the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]]. He danced with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa. He was made master of laws in King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey I]]'s small council.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Storm of Swords]], [[A Storm of Swords-Appendix|Appendix]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===A Feast for Crows===
After Tywin's death, [[Cersei Lannister]] offered him the position of [[Hand of the King]], but he refused because Cersei would not agree to return to [[Casterly Rock]]. He quickly became alienated from his immediate family. He believed Tyrion to be a murderer and came to believe the rumors of incest about Cersei and Jaime. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], became a religious fanatic and abandoned the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan was also angered that [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] received the title of Warden of the West over him, and refused to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returned to the west to see his younger son Martyn.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 33|Chapter 33]], Jaime&lt;/ref&gt; After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] named him Regent of the King. It is unknown as of yet whether he will accept the position.

==Appearance==
Ser Kevan is portly and balding. He has a close-cropped, yellow beard that follows his massive jawline.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 56|Chapter 56]], Tyrion&lt;/ref&gt; He is fat, with rounded shoulders and fair-skinned. He is fifty-five years old.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 7|Chapter 7]], Cersei&lt;/ref&gt;

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' is [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. He served for years as Tywin's most trusted captain. He is known for his reliability and loyalty. Kevan recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age and was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. It is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin hadn't had first. In the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] he is played by Ian Gelder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingfaces.com/2009/09/game-of-thrones-cast-so-far/ Game of Thrones cast so far] on Liftingfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

===A Game of Thrones===
Ser Kevan is with the army under [[Tywin Lannister]]'s command in [[the Riverlands]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 56|Chapter 56]], Tyrion&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Battle of the Green Fork]], he commanded the center which was to wheel to support the left flank should it break. However Lord [[Roose Bolton]] failed to fall for the trap.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 62|Chapter 62]], Tyrion&lt;/ref&gt;

===A Storm of Swords===
Ser Kevan attended the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]]. He danced with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa. He was made master of laws in King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey I]]'s small council.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Storm of Swords]], [[A Storm of Swords-Appendix|Appendix]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===A Feast for Crows===
After Tywin's death, [[Cersei Lannister]] offered him the position of [[Hand of the King]], but he refused because Cersei would not agree to return to [[Casterly Rock]]. He quickly became alienated from his immediate family. He believed Tyrion to be a murderer and came to believe the rumors of incest about Cersei and Jaime. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], became a religious fanatic and abandoned the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan was also angered that [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] received the title of Warden of the West over him, and refused to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returned to the west to see his younger son Martyn.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 33|Chapter 33]], Jaime&lt;/ref&gt; After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] named him Regent of the King.

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepted the role and was made Lord Regent to King Tommen and had set about trying to fix the mess Cersei made.  To placate House Tyrell, Kevan made Mace Tyrell Hand of the King and raised two of Tyrells bannerman to the small council Paxter Redwyne was made the Lord Admiral and Lord Randyll Tarly the justiciar (master of laws).He has also visited the imprisoned Cersei, confronted her about her affair with his son Lancel and has stated to her that regardless of the outcome of her trial her rule is now at an end. Ser Kevan when calling upon Pycelle (Kevan was told by a servant the Grandmaestar was seeking him) found Pycelle dead in the rookery where Varys appeared suddenly and shot Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologised to Kevan as he lay dying stating that he bore Kevan no ill will that he was &quot;...a good man in service to bad causes&quot; but Varys could not allow him to undo Cersei work. Varys stated he did it for the realm and for King Aegon VI.

===A Dance with Dragons===

Varys stated he did it for the realm and for King Aegon VI.

Tyrion once described Kevan to [[Aegon Targaryen]] thusly ''&quot;...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father&quot;'' however in his few appearances after Tywins death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right (which was the main reason Varys killed him). Despite not being a Lord in his own right, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing.

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' is [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. He served for years as Tywin's most trusted captain. He is known for his reliability and loyalty. Kevan recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age and was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. It is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin hadn't had first. In the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] he is played by Ian Gelder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingfaces.com/2009/09/game-of-thrones-cast-so-far/ Game of Thrones cast so far] on Liftingfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

He quickly became alienated from his immediate family and came to believe Tyrion to be a murderer of Joffrey and to believe the rumors of incest about Cersei and Jaime. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], became a religious fanatic and abandoned the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan was also angered that [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] received the title of Warden of the West over him, and refused to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returned to the west to see his younger son Martyn.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 33|Chapter 33]], Jaime&lt;/ref&gt; After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] named him Regent of the King.

Tyrion once described Kevan to [[Aegon Targaryen]] thusly ''&quot;...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father&quot;'' however in his few appearances after Tywins death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right (which was the main reason Varys killed him).

He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end. Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Dance with Dragons]], [[Epilogue (A Dance with Dragons)|Epilogue]]&lt;/ref&gt; He finds Pycelle dead in the [[rookery]]. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will, but that he was &quot;...a good man in service to bad causes.&quot; Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work. Varys states he acts for the realm and for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]].

He tells Cersei that from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] that she is as mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Cersei out of spite appoints two Lannister cousins in the position of Warden of the West and Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]] respectively, positions that Kevan was better suited for.

Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest about Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 33|Chapter 33]], Jaime&lt;/ref&gt; After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  To placate [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the small council: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end. Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Dance with Dragons]], [[Epilogue (A Dance with Dragons)|Epilogue]]&lt;/ref&gt; He finds Pycelle dead in the maestars chambers. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will, but that he was &quot;...a good man in service to bad causes.&quot; Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work. Varys states he acts for the realm and for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. He then commands two of his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off.

==Appearance and Personality==
Ser Kevan is portly and balding. He has a close-cropped, yellow beard that follows his massive jawline.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 56|Chapter 56]], Tyrion&lt;/ref&gt; He is fat, with rounded shoulders and fair-skinned. He is fifty-five years old.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 7|Chapter 7]], Cersei&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that &quot;the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot; However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' is [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. In the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] he is played by Ian Gelder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingfaces.com/2009/09/game-of-thrones-cast-so-far/ Game of Thrones cast so far] on Liftingfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
Ser Kevan is portly and balding. He has a close-cropped, yellow beard that follows his massive jawline.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 56|Chapter 56]], Tyrion&lt;/ref&gt; He is fat, with rounded shoulders and fair-skinned. He is fifty-five years old.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 7|Chapter 7]], Cersei&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
He served for years as Tywin's most trusted captain. He is known for his reliability and loyalty. Kevan recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age and was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. It is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin hadn't had first. 

==Recent Events==
===A Game of Thrones===
Ser Kevan is with the army under [[Tywin Lannister]]'s command in [[the Riverlands]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 56|Chapter 56]], Tyrion&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Battle of the Green Fork]], he commands the center, which is to wheel to support the left flank, should it break. However, Lord [[Roose Bolton]] fails to fall for the trap.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 62|Chapter 62]], Tyrion&lt;/ref&gt;

===A Clash of Kings===
He accompanies his brother's army in the attack on [[House Tully|Tully]] forces when the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] host tries to return to the [[Westerlands]] to destroy the army of [[Robb Stark]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A Clash of Kings]], [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 38|Chapter 38]], Arya&lt;/ref&gt; He also takes part in the attack on [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s flank during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

===A Storm of Swords===
Ser Kevan attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]]. He dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa. He is made [[Master of Laws]] in King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]'s small council.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Storm of Swords]], [[A Storm of Swords-Appendix|Appendix]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===A Feast for Crows===
[[File:Kevan Lannister.png|200px|thumb|left|Ian Gelder as Kevan Lannister]] 
After Tywin's death, [[Cersei Lannister]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand. Cersei must also return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] that she is as bad a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later Cersei out of spite appoints two Lannister cousins in the position of Warden of the West and Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]] respectively, positions that Kevan was better suited for.

Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest about Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 33|Chapter 33]], Jaime&lt;/ref&gt; After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  To placate [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the small council: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end. Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Dance with Dragons]], [[Epilogue (A Dance with Dragons)|Epilogue]]&lt;/ref&gt; He finds Pycelle dead in the maestars chambers. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will, but that he was &quot;...a good man in service to bad causes.&quot; Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work. Varys states he acts for the realm and for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. He then commands two of his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

Kevan recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age and was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. It is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin hadn't had first.

He was described as his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth. He rode in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]] due to the fact his horse was terrifed of Thoros's flaming sword.

[[File:Kevan Lannister.png|200px|thumb|left|Ian Gelder as Kevan Lannister]] 
After Tywin's death, [[Cersei Lannister]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand. Cersei must also return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] that she is as bad a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later Cersei out of spite appoints two Lannister cousins in the position of Warden of the West and Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]] respectively, positions that Kevan was better suited for.

Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest about Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 33|Chapter 33]], Jaime&lt;/ref&gt; After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  To placate [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the small council: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end. Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Dance with Dragons]], [[Epilogue (A Dance with Dragons)|Epilogue]]&lt;/ref&gt; He finds Pycelle dead in the maestars chambers. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will, but that he was &quot;...a good man in service to bad causes.&quot; Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work. Varys states he acts for the realm and for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. He then commands two of his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off.

[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that &quot;the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot; However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

He also comes to believe the rumors of incest about Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 33|Chapter 33]], Jaime&lt;/ref&gt; After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  To placate [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the small council: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end. Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Dance with Dragons]], [[Epilogue (A Dance with Dragons)|Epilogue]]&lt;/ref&gt; He finds Pycelle dead in the maestars chambers. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will, but that he was &quot;...a good man in service to bad causes.&quot; Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work. Varys states he acts for the realm and for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. He then commands two of his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off.

[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that &quot;the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot; However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' is [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. In the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] he is played by Ian Gelder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingfaces.com/2009/09/game-of-thrones-cast-so-far/ Game of Thrones cast so far] on Liftingfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
Ser Kevan is portly and balding. He has a close-cropped, yellow beard that follows his massive jawline.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 56|Chapter 56]], Tyrion&lt;/ref&gt; He is fat, with rounded shoulders and fair-skinned. He is fifty-five years old.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 7|Chapter 7]], Cersei&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
He served for years as Tywin's most trusted captain. He is known for his reliability and loyalty. Kevan recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age and was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. It is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin hadn't had first.

He was described as his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth. He rode in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]] due to the fact his horse was terrifed of Thoros's flaming sword.

==Recent Events==

She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] that she is as bad a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later Cersei out of spite appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for. [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made Warden of the West and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]].

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' is [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. In the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] he is played by Ian Gelder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingfaces.com/2009/09/game-of-thrones-cast-so-far/ Game of Thrones cast so far] on Liftingfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
Ser Kevan is portly and balding. He has a close-cropped, yellow beard that follows his massive jawline.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 56|Chapter 56]], Tyrion&lt;/ref&gt; He is fat, with rounded shoulders and fair-skinned. He is fifty-five years old.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 7|Chapter 7]], Cersei&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
He served for years as Tywin's most trusted captain. He is known for his reliability and loyalty. Kevan recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age and was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. It is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin hadn't had first.

He was described as his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth. He rode in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]] due to the fact his horse was terrifed of Thoros's flaming sword.

==Recent Events==
===A Game of Thrones===
[[File:Kevan Lannister.png|200px|thumb|left|Ian Gelder as Kevan Lannister]] 

Ser Kevan is with the army under [[Tywin Lannister]]'s command in [[the Riverlands]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 56|Chapter 56]], Tyrion&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Battle of the Green Fork]], he commands the center, which is to wheel to support the left flank, should it break. However, Lord [[Roose Bolton]] fails to fall for the trap.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 62|Chapter 62]], Tyrion&lt;/ref&gt; 

When word reaches the Lannsiter camp of the defeat of [[Jaime Lannister|Jaimes]] army near [[Riverrun]], Tywin orders Kevan to command [[Gregor Clegane]], [[Amory Lorch]] and [[Vargo Hoat]] to led there reavers and set the [[Riverlands]] afire from the [[Gods Eye]] to the red fork while the rest of there host re-delpoys at [[Harrenhal]].

===A Clash of Kings===
He accompanies his brother's army in the attack on [[House Tully|Tully]] forces when the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] host tries to return to the [[Westerlands]] to destroy the army of [[Robb Stark]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A Clash of Kings]], [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 38|Chapter 38]], Arya&lt;/ref&gt; He also takes part in the attack on [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s flank during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

===A Storm of Swords===
Ser Kevan attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]]. He dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa. He is made [[Master of Laws]] in King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]'s small council.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Storm of Swords]], [[A Storm of Swords-Appendix|Appendix]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===A Feast for Crows===
After Tywin's death, [[Cersei Lannister]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as bad a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later Cersei out of spite appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made Warden of the West and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brothers body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 33|Chapter 33]], Jaime&lt;/ref&gt; After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  To placate [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the small council: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end.

Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will, but that he was &quot;...a good man in service to bad causes.&quot; Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work; with his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe Kevan murdered by Tyrion or House Tyrell, who in turn will suspect her, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne, opening the way for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. Varys then commands two of his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off.

[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that &quot;the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot; However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' is [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. In the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] he is played by Ian Gelder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingfaces.com/2009/09/game-of-thrones-cast-so-far/ Game of Thrones cast so far] on Liftingfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
Ser Kevan is portly and balding. He has a close-cropped, yellow beard that follows his massive jawline.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 56|Chapter 56]], Tyrion&lt;/ref&gt; He is fat, with rounded shoulders and fair-skinned. He is fifty-five years old.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 7|Chapter 7]], Cersei&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
He served for years as Tywin's most trusted captain. He is known for his reliability and loyalty. Kevan recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age and was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. It is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin hadn't had first.

He was described as his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth. He rode in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]] due to the fact his horse was terrifed of Thoros's flaming sword.

==Recent Events==
===A Game of Thrones===
Ser Kevan is with the army under [[Tywin Lannister]]'s command in [[the Riverlands]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 56|Chapter 56]], Tyrion&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Kevan Lannister.png|200px|thumb|left|Ian Gelder as Kevan Lannister]] 

At the [[Battle of the Green Fork]], he commands the center, which is to wheel to support the left flank, should it break. However, Lord [[Roose Bolton]] fails to fall for the trap.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 62|Chapter 62]], Tyrion&lt;/ref&gt; 
When word reaches the Lannsiter camp of the defeat of [[Jaime Lannister|Jaimes]] army near [[Riverrun]], Tywin orders Kevan to command [[Gregor Clegane]], [[Amory Lorch]] and [[Vargo Hoat]] to led there reavers and set the [[Riverlands]] afire from the [[Gods Eye]] to the red fork while the rest of there host re-delpoys at [[Harrenhal]].

===A Clash of Kings===
He accompanies his brother's army in the attack on [[House Tully|Tully]] forces when the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] host tries to return to the [[Westerlands]] to destroy the army of [[Robb Stark]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A Clash of Kings]], [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 38|Chapter 38]], Arya&lt;/ref&gt; He also takes part in the attack on [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s flank during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

===A Storm of Swords===
Ser Kevan attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]]. He dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa. He is made [[Master of Laws]] in King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]'s small council.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Storm of Swords]], [[A Storm of Swords-Appendix|Appendix]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===A Feast for Crows===
After Tywin's death, [[Cersei Lannister]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as bad a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later Cersei out of spite appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made Warden of the West and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brothers body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 33|Chapter 33]], Jaime&lt;/ref&gt; After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  To placate [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the small council: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end. Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Dance with Dragons]], [[Epilogue (A Dance with Dragons)|Epilogue]]&lt;/ref&gt; He finds Pycelle dead in the maestars chambers.

{{Quote|''&quot;...This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes...&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;[[A Dance with Dragons]], [[Epilogue (A Dance with Dragons)|Epilogue]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work; with his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe Kevan murdered by Tyrion or House Tyrell, who in turn will suspect her, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne, opening the way for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. Varys then commands two of his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off.
[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that &quot;the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot; However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' is [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. In the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] he is played by Ian Gelder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingfaces.com/2009/09/game-of-thrones-cast-so-far/ Game of Thrones cast so far] on Liftingfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
Ser Kevan is portly and balding. He has a close-cropped, yellow beard that follows his massive jawline.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 56|Chapter 56]], Tyrion&lt;/ref&gt; He is fat, with rounded shoulders and fair-skinned. He is fifty-five years old.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 7|Chapter 7]], Cersei&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
He served for years as Tywin's most trusted captain. He is known for his reliability and loyalty. Kevan recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age and was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. It is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin hadn't had first.

He was described as his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth. He rode in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]] due to the fact his horse was terrifed of Thoros's flaming sword.

==Recent Events==
===A Game of Thrones===
Ser Kevan is with the army under [[Tywin Lannister]]'s command in [[the Riverlands]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 56|Chapter 56]], Tyrion&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Kevan Lannister.png|200px|thumb|left|Ian Gelder as Kevan Lannister]] 

At the [[Battle of the Green Fork]], he commands the center, which is to wheel to support the left flank, should it break. However, Lord [[Roose Bolton]] fails to fall for the trap.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 62|Chapter 62]], Tyrion&lt;/ref&gt; 
When word reaches the Lannsiter camp of the defeat of [[Jaime Lannister|Jaimes]] army near [[Riverrun]], Tywin orders Kevan to command [[Gregor Clegane]], [[Amory Lorch]] and [[Vargo Hoat]] to led there reavers and set the [[Riverlands]] afire from the [[Gods Eye]] to the red fork while the rest of there host re-delpoys at [[Harrenhal]].

===A Clash of Kings===
He accompanies his brother's army in the attack on [[House Tully|Tully]] forces when the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] host tries to return to the [[Westerlands]] to destroy the army of [[Robb Stark]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A Clash of Kings]], [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 38|Chapter 38]], Arya&lt;/ref&gt; He also takes part in the attack on [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s flank during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

===A Storm of Swords===
Ser Kevan attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]]. He dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa. He is made [[Master of Laws]] in King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]'s small council.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Storm of Swords]], [[A Storm of Swords-Appendix|Appendix]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===A Feast for Crows===
After Tywin's death, [[Cersei Lannister]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as bad a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later Cersei out of spite appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made Warden of the West and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brothers body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 33|Chapter 33]], Jaime&lt;/ref&gt; After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  To placate [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the small council: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end. Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Dance with Dragons]], [[Epilogue (A Dance with Dragons)|Epilogue]]&lt;/ref&gt; He finds Pycelle dead in the maestars chambers. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

{{Quote|''&quot;...This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes...&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;[[A Dance with Dragons]], [[Epilogue (A Dance with Dragons)|Epilogue]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Varys then commands two of his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off.

===Legacy===
Ser Kevan Lannister spent most of his life n his older brothers shadow, after [[Joanna Lannister]]s death Kevan became Tywins most trusted captain and confidant. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that... 

{{Quote|''&quot;...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot;''}} 

However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing. His leadership and diplomatic skills allowed him to placate [[House Tyrell]] after the damage Cersei did to the alliance with the House. Kevan also was in the process of binding the [[Faith of the Seven]] behind [[Tommen I]]. [[Varys]] knew Kevan could have succeeded in repairing the [[Iron Throne]]s Tyrell/Lannister alliance and making it a severe threat to [[Aegon Targaryen|Aegon VI]] claim, thus the reason Varys had Kevan killed.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 33|Chapter 33]], Jaime&lt;/ref&gt; After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  To placate [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the small council: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end. Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Dance with Dragons]], [[Epilogue (A Dance with Dragons)|Epilogue]]&lt;/ref&gt; He finds Pycelle dead in the maestars chambers. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

{{Quote|''&quot;...This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes...&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;[[A Dance with Dragons]], [[Epilogue (A Dance with Dragons)|Epilogue]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work; with his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe Kevan murdered by Tyrion or House Tyrell, who in turn will suspect her, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne, opening the way for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. Varys then commands two of his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off.

===Legacy===
Ser Kevan Lannister spent most of his life in his older brother's shadow. After [[Joanna Lannister]]'s death Kevan became Tywin's most trusted captain and confidant. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that... 

{{Quote|''&quot;...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot;''}} 

However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing. His leadership and diplomatic skills allowed him to placate [[House Tyrell]] after the damage Cersei did to the alliance with the House. Kevan also was in the process of binding the [[Faith of the Seven]] behind [[Tommen I]]. [[Varys]] knew Kevan could have succeeded in repairing the [[Iron Throne]]s Tyrell/Lannister alliance and making it a severe threat to [[Aegon Targaryen|Aegon VI]] claim, thus the reason Varys had Kevan killed.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' is [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. In the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] he is played by Ian Gelder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingfaces.com/2009/09/game-of-thrones-cast-so-far/ Game of Thrones cast so far] on Liftingfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
Ser Kevan is portly and balding. He has a close-cropped, yellow beard that follows his massive jawline.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 56|Chapter 56]], Tyrion&lt;/ref&gt; He is fat, with rounded shoulders and fair-skinned. He is fifty-five years old.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Feast for Crows]], [[A Feast for Crows-Chapter 7|Chapter 7]], Cersei&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
He served for years as Tywin's most trusted captain. He is known for his reliability and loyalty. Kevan recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age and was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. It is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin hadn't had first.

He was described as his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth. He rode in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]] due to the fact his horse was terrifed of Thoros's flaming sword.

==Recent Events==
===A Game of Thrones===
Ser Kevan is with the army under [[Tywin Lannister]]'s command in [[the Riverlands]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 56|Chapter 56]], Tyrion&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Kevan Lannister.png|200px|thumb|left|Ian Gelder as Kevan Lannister]] 

At the [[Battle of the Green Fork]], he commands the center, which is to wheel to support the left flank, should it break. However, Lord [[Roose Bolton]] fails to fall for the trap.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Game of Thrones]], [[A Game of Thrones-Chapter 62|Chapter 62]], Tyrion&lt;/ref&gt; 
When word reaches the Lannsiter camp of the defeat of [[Jaime Lannister|Jaimes]] army near [[Riverrun]], Tywin orders Kevan to command [[Gregor Clegane]], [[Amory Lorch]] and [[Vargo Hoat]] to led their reavers and set the [[Riverlands]] afire from the [[Gods Eye]] to the Red Fork while the rest of their host re-deploys at [[Harrenhal]].

===A Clash of Kings===
He accompanies his brother's army in the attack on [[House Tully|Tully]] forces when the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] host tries to return to the [[Westerlands]] to destroy the army of [[Robb Stark]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A Clash of Kings]], [[A Clash of Kings-Chapter 38|Chapter 38]], Arya&lt;/ref&gt; He also takes part in the attack on [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s flank during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

===A Storm of Swords===
Ser Kevan attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]]. He dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa. He is made [[Master of Laws]] in King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]'s small council.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Storm of Swords]], [[A Storm of Swords-Appendix|Appendix]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===A Feast for Crows===
After Tywin's death, [[Cersei Lannister]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as bad a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later Cersei out of spite appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made Warden of the West and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brothers body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position.

Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as bad a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later Cersei out of spite appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made Warden of the West and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brothers body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].{{Ref|aFfC|33}} After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.{{Ref|aFfC|42}}

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  To placate [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the small council: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end. Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}} He finds Pycelle dead in the maestars chambers. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

{{Quote|''&quot;...This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes...&quot;'' {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}}}

Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work; with his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe Kevan murdered by Tyrion or House Tyrell, who in turn will suspect her, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne, opening the way for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. Varys then commands two of his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off.

===Legacy===
Ser Kevan Lannister spent most of his life in his older brother's shadow. After [[Joanna Lannister]]'s death Kevan became Tywin's most trusted captain and confidant. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that... 

{{Quote|''&quot;...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot;''}} 

However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing. His leadership and diplomatic skills allowed him to placate [[House Tyrell]] after the damage Cersei did to the alliance with the House. Kevan also was in the process of binding the [[Faith of the Seven]] behind [[Tommen I]]. [[Varys]] knew Kevan could have succeeded in repairing the [[Iron Throne]]s Tyrell/Lannister alliance and making it a severe threat to [[Aegon Targaryen|Aegon VI]] claim, thus the reason Varys had Kevan killed.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

Ser Kevan attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]]. He dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa. He is made [[Master of Laws]] in King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]'s small council.{{Ref|aSoS|Appendix}}

===A Feast for Crows===
After Tywin's death, [[Cersei Lannister]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as bad a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later Cersei out of spite appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made Warden of the West and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brothers body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].{{Ref|aFfC|33}} After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.{{Ref|aFfC|43}}

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  To placate [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the small council: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end. Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}} He finds Pycelle dead in the maestars chambers. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

{{Quote|''&quot;...This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes...&quot;'' {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}}}

Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work; with his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe Kevan murdered by Tyrion or House Tyrell, who in turn will suspect her, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne, opening the way for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. Varys then commands two of his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off.

===Legacy===
Ser Kevan Lannister spent most of his life in his older brother's shadow. After [[Joanna Lannister]]'s death Kevan became Tywin's most trusted captain and confidant. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that... 

{{Quote|''&quot;...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot;''}} 

However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing. His leadership and diplomatic skills allowed him to placate [[House Tyrell]] after the damage Cersei did to the alliance with the House. Kevan also was in the process of binding the [[Faith of the Seven]] behind [[Tommen I]]. [[Varys]] knew Kevan could have succeeded in repairing the [[Iron Throne]]s Tyrell/Lannister alliance and making it a severe threat to [[Aegon Targaryen|Aegon VI]] claim, thus the reason Varys had Kevan killed.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

==History==
He served for years as Tywin's most trusted captain. He is known for his reliability and loyalty.

He was described as his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth. He rode in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]] due to the fact his horse was terrifed of Thoros's flaming sword.

While it was said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin didn’t have first, he isnt stupid, he just recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age and was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. He is known for his reliability and loyalty.

After the [[Battle of the Blackwater|siege on king's Landing]] was lifted, King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] appointed Ser Kevan to his [[small council]] as [[Master of Laws]].{{Ref|aSoS|Appendix}} He also attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]], where he dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa.

===A Feast for Crows===
Following the death of his brother, Tywin, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister|[Cersei]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and she return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as bad a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later Cersei out of spite appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made [[Warden of the West]] and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brothers body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].{{Ref|aFfC|33}} After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.{{Ref|aFfC|43}}

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  To placate [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the [[small council]]: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end. Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}} He finds Pycelle dead in the maestars chambers. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

{{Quote|''&quot;...This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes...&quot;'' {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}}}

Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work; with his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe Kevan murdered by Tyrion or House Tyrell, who in turn will suspect her, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne, opening the way for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. Varys then commands two of his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off.

===Legacy===
Ser Kevan Lannister spent most of his life in his older brother's shadow. After [[Joanna Lannister]]'s death Kevan became Tywin's most trusted captain and confidant. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that... 

{{Quote|''&quot;...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot;''}} 

However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing. His leadership and diplomatic skills allowed him to placate [[House Tyrell]] after the damage Cersei did to the alliance with the House. Kevan also was in the process of binding the [[Faith of the Seven]] behind [[Tommen I]]. [[Varys]] knew Kevan could have succeeded in repairing the [[Iron Throne]]s Tyrell/Lannister alliance and making it a severe threat to [[Aegon Targaryen|Aegon VI]] claim, thus the reason Varys had Kevan killed.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

While it was said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin didn’t have first, he isnt stupid, he just recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age and was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. He is known for his reliability and loyalty.

Ser Kevan accompanies [[Tywin Lannister]] during his [[War of the Five Kings|campaign]] in [[the Riverlands]].{{Ref|aGoT|56}} At the [[Battle of the Green Fork]], he commands the center, which is to wheel to support the left flank, should it break. Following their victory and discovery of [[Robb Stark]], they move to [[Riverrun]].{{Ref|aGoT|62}} 

However, when word reaches of the defeat at the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] and the capture of his nephew, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], he continued with the rest of the army to [[Harrenhal]]. Where Tywin orders Kevan to command [[Gregor Clegane]], [[Amory Lorch]] and [[Vargo Hoat]] leading their reavers and set the [[Riverlands]] afire from the [[Gods Eye]] to the Red Fork while the rest of their host re-deploys at [[Harrenhal]].

===A Clash of Kings===
Kevan accompanies his brother's attempt to force his way into the [[Westerlands]] and took part in the [[Battle of the Fords]], he retreated with the army after the defeat at [[Stone Mill]] ford.{{Ref|aCoK|38}} Later he takes part in the attack on [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s flank during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

===A Storm of Swords===
After the [[Battle of the Blackwater|siege on King's Landing]] was lifted, King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] appointed Ser Kevan to his [[small council]] as [[Master of Laws]].{{Ref|aSoS|Appendix}} He also attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]], where he dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa.

===A Feast for Crows===
Following the death of his brother, Tywin, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and she return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as unfit a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later, Cersei, out of spite, appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made [[Warden of the West]] and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brother's body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].{{Ref|aFfC|33}} After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.{{Ref|aFfC|43}}

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  To placate [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the [[small council]]: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end. Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}} He finds Pycelle dead in the maestars chambers. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

{{Quote|''&quot;...This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes...&quot;'' {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}}}

Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work; with his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe Kevan murdered by Tyrion or House Tyrell, who in turn will suspect her, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne, opening the way for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. Varys then commands two of his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off.

===Legacy===
Ser Kevan Lannister spent most of his life in his older brother's shadow. After [[Joanna Lannister]]'s death Kevan became Tywin's most trusted captain and confidant. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that... 

{{Quote|''&quot;...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot;''}} 

However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing. His leadership and diplomatic skills allowed him to placate [[House Tyrell]] after the damage Cersei did to the alliance with the House. Kevan also was in the process of binding the [[Faith of the Seven]] behind [[Tommen I]]. [[Varys]] knew Kevan could have succeeded in repairing the [[Iron Throne]]s Tyrell/Lannister alliance and making it a severe threat to [[Aegon Targaryen|Aegon VI]] claim, thus the reason Varys had Kevan killed.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

==Appearance and Character==
Ser Kevan is portly and balding. He has a close-cropped, yellow beard that follows his massive jawline.{{Ref|aGoT|56}} He is fat, with rounded shoulders and fair-skinned. He is fifty-five years old.{{Ref|aFfC|7}}

While it is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin didn’t have first, he is by no means stupid; he simply recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age. Kevan was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. He is known for his reliability and loyalty.

==History==
For years Kevan served as Tywin's most trusted captain. Kevan fought in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]]; his horse was terrifed of the red priest's flaming sword. He was described by his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth.

Kevan married [[Dorna Swyft]] and they have four children: [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], twin boys [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]] and [[Willem Lannister|Willem]], and a newborn daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

[[File:Kevan Lannister.png|250px|thumb|Ian Gelder as Kevan Lannister ([[Game of Thrones|TV series]])]] 

Ser Kevan accompanies [[Tywin Lannister]] during his [[War of the Five Kings|campaign]] in [[the Riverlands]].{{Ref|aGoT|56}} At the [[Battle of the Green Fork]], he commands the center, which is to wheel to support the left flank, should it break. Following their victory and discovery of [[Robb Stark]], they move to [[Riverrun]].{{Ref|aGoT|62}} 

However, when word reaches of the defeat at the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] and the capture of his nephew, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], he continued with the rest of the army to [[Harrenhal]]. Where Tywin orders Kevan to command [[Gregor Clegane]], [[Amory Lorch]] and [[Vargo Hoat]] leading their reavers and set the [[Riverlands]] afire from the [[Gods Eye]] to the Red Fork while the rest of their host re-deploys at [[Harrenhal]].

===A Clash of Kings===
Kevan accompanies his brother's attempt to force his way into the [[Westerlands]] and took part in the [[Battle of the Fords]], he retreated with the army after the defeat at [[Stone Mill]] ford.{{Ref|aCoK|38}} Later he takes part in the attack on [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s flank during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

===A Storm of Swords===
After the [[Battle of the Blackwater|siege on King's Landing]] was lifted, King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] appointed Ser Kevan to his [[small council]] as [[Master of Laws]].{{Ref|aSoS|Appendix}} He also attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]], where he dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa.

===A Feast for Crows===
Following the death of his brother, Tywin, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and she return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as unfit a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later, Cersei, out of spite, appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made [[Warden of the West]] and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brother's body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].{{Ref|aFfC|33}} After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.{{Ref|aFfC|43}}

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  As a sinecure to [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the [[small council]]: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. 
He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Dance with Dragons]], [[Cersei I (A Dance with Dragons)|Cersei I]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He discusses with the [[small council]] on how to deal with the crowns crisis of [[Jon Connington]] and his [[Aegon Targaryen|feigned dragon]] and the crowns financal . He later has supper with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Tommen I|King Tommen]].
Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}} He finds Pycelle dead in the maestars chambers. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

{{Quote|''&quot;...This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes...&quot;'' {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}}}

Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work; with his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe Kevan murdered by Tyrion or House Tyrell, who in turn will suspect her, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne, opening the way for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. Varys then commands two of his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off.

While it is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin didn’t have first, he is by no means stupid; he simply recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age. Kevan was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. He is known for his reliability and loyalty.

==History==
For years Kevan served as Tywin's most trusted captain. Kevan fought in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]]; his horse was terrifed of the red priest's flaming sword. He was described by his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth.

Kevan married [[Dorna Swyft]] and they have four children: [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], twin boys [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]] and [[Willem Lannister|Willem]], and a newborn daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' is [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. In the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] he is played by Ian Gelder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingfaces.com/2009/09/game-of-thrones-cast-so-far/ Game of Thrones cast so far] on Liftingfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance and Character==
Ser Kevan is portly and balding. He has a close-cropped, yellow beard that follows his massive jawline.{{Ref|aGoT|56}} He is fat, with rounded shoulders and fair-skinned. He is fifty-five years old.{{Ref|aFfC|7}}

While it is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin didn’t have first, he is by no means stupid; he simply recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age. Kevan was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. He is known for his reliability and loyalty.

==History==
For years Kevan served as Tywin's most trusted captain. Kevan fought in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]]; his horse was terrifed of the red priest's flaming sword. He was described by his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth.

Kevan married [[Dorna Swyft]] and they have four children: [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], twin boys [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]] and [[Willem Lannister|Willem]], and a newborn daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

[[File:Kevan Lannister.png|250px|thumb|Ian Gelder as Kevan Lannister ([[Game of Thrones|TV series]])]] 

Ser Kevan accompanies [[Tywin Lannister]] during his [[War of the Five Kings|campaign]] in [[the Riverlands]].{{Ref|aGoT|56}} At the [[Battle of the Green Fork]], he commands the center, which is to wheel to support the left flank, should it break. Following their victory and discovery of [[Robb Stark]], they move to [[Riverrun]].{{Ref|aGoT|62}} 

However, when word reaches of the defeat at the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] and the capture of his nephew, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], he continued with the rest of the army to [[Harrenhal]]. Where Tywin orders Kevan to command [[Gregor Clegane]], [[Amory Lorch]] and [[Vargo Hoat]] leading their reavers and set the [[Riverlands]] afire from the [[Gods Eye]] to the Red Fork while the rest of their host re-deploys at [[Harrenhal]].

===A Clash of Kings===
Kevan accompanies his brother's attempt to force his way into the [[Westerlands]] and took part in the [[Battle of the Fords]], he retreated with the army after the defeat at [[Stone Mill]] ford.{{Ref|aCoK|38}} Later he takes part in the attack on [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s flank during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

===A Storm of Swords===
After the [[Battle of the Blackwater|siege on King's Landing]] was lifted, King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] appointed Ser Kevan to his [[small council]] as [[Master of Laws]].{{Ref|aSoS|Appendix}} He also attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]], where he dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa.

===A Feast for Crows===
Following the death of his brother, Tywin, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and she return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as unfit a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later, Cersei, out of spite, appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made [[Warden of the West]] and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brother's body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].{{Ref|aFfC|33}} After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.{{Ref|aFfC|43}}

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  As a sinecure to [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the [[small council]]: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. 
He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Dance with Dragons]], [[Cersei I (A Dance with Dragons)|Cersei I]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He discusses with the [[small council]] on how to deal with the crowns crisis of [[Jon Connington]] and his [[Aegon Targaryen|feigned dragon]] and the crowns financial problems. He later has supper with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Tommen I|King Tommen]].
Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}} He finds Pycelle dead in the Grand Maester's chambers. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

{{Quote|''&quot;...This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes...&quot;'' {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}}}

Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work; with his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe Kevan murdered by Tyrion or House Tyrell, who in turn will suspect her, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne, opening the way for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. Varys then commands two of his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}.

===Legacy===
Ser Kevan Lannister spent most of his life in his older brother's shadow. After [[Joanna Lannister]]'s death Kevan became Tywin's most trusted captain and confidant. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that... 

{{Quote|''&quot;...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot;''}} 

However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing. His leadership and diplomatic skills allowed him to placate [[House Tyrell]] after the damage Cersei did to the alliance with the House. Kevan also was in the process of binding the [[Faith of the Seven]] behind [[Tommen I]]. [[Varys]] knew Kevan could have succeeded in repairing the [[Iron Throne]]s Tyrell/Lannister alliance and making it a severe threat to [[Aegon Targaryen|Aegon VI]] claim, thus the reason Varys had Kevan killed.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

Ser Kevan Lannister spent most of his life in his older brother's shadow. After [[Joanna Lannister]]'s death Kevan became Tywin's most trusted captain and confidant. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that... 

{{Quote|''&quot;...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot;''}} 

However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing. His leadership and diplomatic skills allowed him to placate [[House Tyrell]] after the damage Cersei did to the alliance with the House. Kevan also was in the process of binding the [[Faith of the Seven]] behind [[Tommen I]]. [[Varys]] knew Kevan could have succeeded in repairing the [[Iron Throne]]s Tyrell/Lannister alliance and making it a severe threat to [[Aegon Targaryen|Aegon VI]] claim, thus the reason Varys had Kevan killed.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' is [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. In the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] he is played by Ian Gelder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingfaces.com/2009/09/game-of-thrones-cast-so-far/ Game of Thrones cast so far] on Liftingfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance and Character==
Ser Kevan is portly and balding. He has a close-cropped, yellow beard that follows his massive jawline.{{Ref|aGoT|56}} He is fat, with rounded shoulders and fair-skinned. He is fifty-five years old.{{Ref|aFfC|7}}

While it is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin didn’t have first, he is by no means stupid; he simply recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age. Kevan was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. He is known for his reliability and loyalty.

==History==
For years Kevan served as Tywin's most trusted captain. Kevan fought in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]]; his horse was terrifed of the red priest's flaming sword. He was described by his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth.

Kevan married [[Dorna Swyft]] and they have four children: [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], twin boys [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]] and [[Willem Lannister|Willem]], and a newborn daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

==Recent Events==
===A Game of Thrones===
[[File:Kevan Lannister.png|250px|thumb|Ian Gelder as Kevan Lannister ([[Game of Thrones|TV series]])]] 

Ser Kevan accompanies [[Tywin Lannister]] during his [[War of the Five Kings|campaign]] in [[the Riverlands]].{{Ref|aGoT|56}} At the [[Battle of the Green Fork]], he commands the center, a mixed force which is to wheel to support the left flank, should it break. Following their victory and discovery of [[Robb Stark]], they move to [[Riverrun]].{{Ref|aGoT|62}} 

However, when word reaches of the defeat at the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] and the capture of his nephew, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], he continued with the rest of the army to [[Harrenhal]]. Where Tywin orders Kevan to command [[Gregor Clegane]], [[Amory Lorch]] and [[Vargo Hoat]] leading their reavers and set the [[Riverlands]] afire from the [[Gods Eye]] to the Red Fork while the rest of their host re-deploys at [[Harrenhal]].

===A Clash of Kings===
Kevan accompanies his brother's attempt to force his way into the [[Westerlands]] and took part in the [[Battle of the Fords]], he retreated with the army after the defeat at [[Stone Mill]] ford.{{Ref|aCoK|38}} Later he takes part in the attack on [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s flank during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

===A Storm of Swords===
After the [[Battle of the Blackwater|siege on King's Landing]] was lifted, King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] appointed Ser Kevan to his [[small council]] as [[Master of Laws]].{{Ref|aSoS|Appendix}} He also attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]], where he dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa.

===A Feast for Crows===
Following the death of his brother, Tywin, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and she return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as unfit a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later, Cersei, out of spite, appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made [[Warden of the West]] and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brother's body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].{{Ref|aFfC|33}} After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.{{Ref|aFfC|43}}

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  As a sinecure to [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the [[small council]]: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. 
He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Dance with Dragons]], [[Cersei I (A Dance with Dragons)|Cersei I]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He discusses with the [[small council]] on how to deal with the crowns crisis of [[Jon Connington]] and his [[Aegon Targaryen|feigned dragon]] and the crowns financial problems. He later has supper with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Tommen I|King Tommen]].
Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}} He finds Pycelle dead in the Grand Maester's chambers. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

{{Quote|''&quot;...This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes...&quot;'' {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}}}

Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work; with his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe Kevan murdered by Tyrion or House Tyrell, who in turn will suspect her, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne, opening the way for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. Varys then commands two of his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}.

===Legacy===
Ser Kevan Lannister spent most of his life in his older brother's shadow. After [[Joanna Lannister]]'s death Kevan became Tywin's most trusted captain and confidant. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that... 

{{Quote|''&quot;...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot;''}}

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' is [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. In the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] he is played by Ian Gelder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingfaces.com/2009/09/game-of-thrones-cast-so-far/ Game of Thrones cast so far] on Liftingfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance and Character==
Ser Kevan is portly and balding. He has a close-cropped, yellow beard that follows his massive jawline.{{Ref|aGoT|56}} He is fat, with rounded shoulders and fair-skinned. He is fifty-five years old.{{Ref|aFfC|7}}

While it is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin didn’t have first, he is by no means stupid; he simply recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age. Kevan was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. He is known for his reliability and loyalty.

==History==
For years Kevan served as Tywin's most trusted captain. Kevan fought in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]]; his horse was terrifed of the red priest's flaming sword. He was described by his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth.

Kevan married [[Dorna Swyft]] and they have four children: [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], twin boys [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]] and [[Willem Lannister|Willem]], and a newborn daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' is [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. In the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] he is played by Ian Gelder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingfaces.com/2009/09/game-of-thrones-cast-so-far/ Game of Thrones cast so far] on Liftingfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance and Character==
Ser Kevan is portly and balding. He has a close-cropped, yellow beard that follows his massive jawline.{{Ref|aGoT|56}} He is fat, with rounded shoulders and fair-skinned. He is fifty-five years old.{{Ref|aFfC|7}}

While it is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin didn’t have first, he is by no means stupid; he simply recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age. Kevan was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. He is known for his reliability and loyalty.

==History==
For years Kevan served as Tywin's most trusted captain. Kevan fought in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]]; his horse was terrifed of the red priest's flaming sword. He was described by his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth.

Kevan married [[Dorna Swyft]] and they have four children: [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], twin boys [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]] and [[Willem Lannister|Willem]], and a newborn daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

===A Game of Thrones===
[[File:Kevan Lannister.png|250px|thumb|Ian Gelder as Kevan Lannister ([[Game of Thrones|TV series]])]] 

Ser Kevan accompanies [[Tywin Lannister]] during his [[War of the Five Kings|campaign]] in [[the Riverlands]].{{Ref|aGoT|56}} At the [[Battle of the Green Fork]], he commands the center, a mixed force which is to wheel to support the left flank, should it break. Following their victory and discovery of [[Robb Stark]], they move to [[Riverrun]].{{Ref|aGoT|62}} 

However, when word reaches of the defeat at the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] and the capture of his nephew, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], he continued with the rest of the army to [[Harrenhal]]. Where Tywin orders Kevan to command [[Gregor Clegane]], [[Amory Lorch]] and [[Vargo Hoat]] leading their reavers and set the [[Riverlands]] afire from the [[Gods Eye]] to the Red Fork while the rest of their host re-deploys at [[Harrenhal]].

===A Clash of Kings===
Kevan accompanies his brother's attempt to force his way into the [[Westerlands]] and took part in the [[Battle of the Fords]], he retreated with the army after the defeat at [[Stone Mill]] ford.{{Ref|aCoK|38}} Later he takes part in the attack on [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s flank during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

===A Storm of Swords===
After the [[Battle of the Blackwater|siege on King's Landing]] was lifted, King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] appointed Ser Kevan to his [[small council]] as [[Master of Laws]].{{Ref|aSoS|Appendix}} He also attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]], where he dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa.

===A Feast for Crows===
Following the death of his brother, Tywin, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and she return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as unfit a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later, Cersei, out of spite, appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made [[Warden of the West]] and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brother's body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].{{Ref|aFfC|33}} After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.{{Ref|aFfC|43}}

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  As a concession to [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the [[small council]]: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. 
He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end.{{ref|aDwD|54}}

He discusses with the [[small council]] on how to deal with the crown's crisis of [[Jon Connington]] and his [[Aegon Targaryen|feigned dragon]] and the crown's financial problems. He later has supper with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Tommen I|King Tommen]].
Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}} He finds Pycelle dead in the Grand Maester's chambers. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

{{Quote|''&quot;...This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes...&quot;'' {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}}}

Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work; with his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe Kevan murdered by Tyrion or House Tyrell, who in turn will suspect her, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne, opening the way for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. Varys then commands two of his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}.

===Legacy===
Ser Kevan Lannister spent most of his life in his older brother's shadow. After [[Joanna Lannister]]'s death Kevan became Tywin's most trusted captain and confidant. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that... 

{{Quote|''&quot;...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot;''}} 

However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing. His leadership and diplomatic skills allowed him to placate [[House Tyrell]] after the damage Cersei did to the alliance with the House. Kevan also was in the process of binding the [[Faith of the Seven]] behind [[Tommen I]]. [[Varys]] knew Kevan could have succeeded in repairing the [[Iron Throne]]s Tyrell/Lannister alliance and making it a severe threat to [[Aegon Targaryen|Aegon VI]] claim, thus the reason Varys had Kevan killed.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' is [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. In the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] he is played by Ian Gelder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingfaces.com/2009/09/game-of-thrones-cast-so-far/ Game of Thrones cast so far] on Liftingfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance and Character==
Ser Kevan is portly and balding. He has a close-cropped, yellow beard that follows his massive jawline.{{Ref|aGoT|56}} He is fat, with rounded shoulders and fair-skinned. He is fifty-five years old.{{Ref|aFfC|7}}

While it is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin didn’t have first, he is by no means stupid; he simply recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age. Kevan was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. He is known for his reliability and loyalty.

==History==
For years Kevan served as Tywin's most trusted captain. Kevan fought in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]]; his horse was terrifed of the red priest's flaming sword. He was described by his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth.

Kevan married [[Dorna Swyft]] and they have four children: [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], twin boys [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]] and [[Willem Lannister|Willem]], and a newborn daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

==Recent Events==
===A Game of Thrones===
[[File:Kevan Lannister.png|250px|thumb|Ian Gelder as Kevan Lannister ([[Game of Thrones|TV series]])]] 

Ser Kevan accompanies [[Tywin Lannister]] during his [[War of the Five Kings|campaign]] in [[the Riverlands]].{{Ref|aGoT|56}} At the [[Battle of the Green Fork]], he commands the center, a mixed force which is to wheel to support the left flank, should it break. Following their victory and discovery of [[Robb Stark]], they move to [[Riverrun]].{{Ref|aGoT|62}} 

However, when word reaches of the defeat at the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] and the capture of his nephew, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], he continued with the rest of the army to [[Harrenhal]]. Where Tywin orders Kevan to command [[Gregor Clegane]], [[Amory Lorch]] and [[Vargo Hoat]] leading their reavers and set the [[Riverlands]] afire from the [[Gods Eye]] to the Red Fork while the rest of their host re-deploys at [[Harrenhal]].

===A Clash of Kings===
Kevan accompanies his brother's attempt to force his way into the [[Westerlands]] and took part in the [[Battle of the Fords]], he retreated with the army after the defeat at [[Stone Mill]] ford.{{Ref|aCoK|38}} Later he takes part in the attack on [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s flank during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

===A Storm of Swords===
After the [[Battle of the Blackwater|siege on King's Landing]] was lifted, King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] appointed Ser Kevan to his [[small council]] as [[Master of Laws]].{{Ref|aSoS|Appendix}} He also attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]], where he dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa.

===A Feast for Crows===
Following the death of his brother, Tywin, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and she return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as unfit a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later, Cersei, out of spite, appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made [[Warden of the West]] and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brother's body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position.

Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}} He finds Pycelle dead in the Grand Maester's chambers. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' is [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. In the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] he is played by Ian Gelder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingfaces.com/2009/09/game-of-thrones-cast-so-far/ Game of Thrones cast so far] on Liftingfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance and Character==
Ser Kevan is portly and balding. He has a close-cropped, yellow beard that follows his massive jawline.{{Ref|aGoT|56}} He is fat, with rounded shoulders and fair-skinned. He is fifty-five years old.{{Ref|aFfC|7}}

While it is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin didn’t have first, he is by no means stupid; he simply recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age. Kevan was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. He is known for his reliability and loyalty.

==History==
For years Kevan served as Tywin's most trusted captain. Kevan fought in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]]; his horse was terrifed of the red priest's flaming sword. He was described by his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth.

Kevan married [[Dorna Swyft]] and they have four children: [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], twin boys [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]] and [[Willem Lannister|Willem]], and a newborn daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

However, when word reaches Lord Tywins host of the defeat at the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] and of the capture of his nephew, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], he continued with the rest of the army to [[Harrenhal]]. Tywin orders Kevan to command [[Gregor Clegane]], [[Amory Lorch]] and [[Vargo Hoat]] leading their reavers in setting the [[Riverlands]] afire from the [[Gods Eye]] to the Red Fork while the rest of their host re-deploys at [[Harrenhal]].

===A Storm of Swords===
After the [[Battle of the Blackwater|siege on King's Landing]] was lifted, King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] appointed Ser Kevan to his [[small council]] as [[Master of Laws]].{{Ref|aSoS|Appendix}} He also attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]], where he dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa.

He is present when news of the [[Red Wedding]] is received and was appalled by [[Joffrey Baratheon|King Joffreys]] statement that he wanted the head of [[Robb Stark]] so he could serve it to [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] at his own wedding (a request that Tywin refused to grant).

===A Feast for Crows===
Following the death of his brother, Tywin, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and she return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as unfit a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later, Cersei, out of spite, appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made [[Warden of the West]] and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brother's body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].{{Ref|aFfC|33}} After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.{{Ref|aFfC|43}}

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  As a concession to [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the [[small council]]: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. 
He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end.{{ref|aDwD|54}}

He discusses with the [[small council]] on how to deal with the crown's crisis of [[Jon Connington]] and his [[Aegon Targaryen|feigned dragon]] and the crown's financial problems. He later has supper with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Tommen I|King Tommen]].
Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}} He finds Pycelle dead in the Grand Maester's chambers. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

{{Quote|''&quot;...This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes...&quot;'' {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}}}

Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work; with his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe Kevan murdered by Tyrion or House Tyrell, who in turn will suspect her, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne, opening the way for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. Varys then commands two of his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}.

===Legacy===
Ser Kevan Lannister spent most of his life in his older brother's shadow. After [[Joanna Lannister]]'s death Kevan became Tywin's most trusted captain and confidant. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that... 

{{Quote|''&quot;...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot;''}} 

However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing. His leadership and diplomatic skills allowed him to placate [[House Tyrell]] after the damage Cersei did to the alliance with the House. Kevan also was in the process of binding the [[Faith of the Seven]] behind [[Tommen I]]. [[Varys]] knew Kevan could have succeeded in repairing the [[Iron Throne]]s Tyrell/Lannister alliance and making it a severe threat to [[Aegon Targaryen|Aegon VI]] claim, thus the reason Varys had Kevan killed.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

[[Varys]] knew Kevan could have succeeded in repairing the [[Iron Throne]]s Tyrell/Lannister alliance and making it a severe threat to [[Aegon Targaryen|Aegon VI]] claim, thus the reason Varys had Kevan killed.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' is [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. In the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] he is played by Ian Gelder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingfaces.com/2009/09/game-of-thrones-cast-so-far/ Game of Thrones cast so far] on Liftingfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance and Character==
Ser Kevan is described as being a fat fifty five year old man, with rounded shoulders and fair skin.{{Ref|aFfC|7}} He is portly, balding, with close-cropped, yellow beard that follows the line of his massive jaw.{{Ref|aGoT|56}}

While it is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin didn’t have first, he is by no means stupid; he simply recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age. Kevan was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. He is known for his reliability and loyalty.

==History==
For years Kevan served as Tywin's most trusted captain. Kevan fought in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]]; his horse was terrifed of the red priest's flaming sword. He was described by his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth.

Kevan married [[Dorna Swyft]] and they have four children: [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], twin boys [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]] and [[Willem Lannister|Willem]], and a newborn daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

==Recent Events==
===A Game of Thrones===
[[File:Kevan Lannister.png|250px|thumb|Ian Gelder as Kevan Lannister ([[Game of Thrones|TV series]])]] 

Ser Kevan accompanies [[Tywin Lannister]] during his [[War of the Five Kings|campaign]] in [[the Riverlands]].{{Ref|aGoT|56}} At the [[Battle of the Green Fork]], he commands the center, a mixed force which is to wheel to support the left flank, should it break. Following their victory and discovery of [[Robb Stark]], they move to [[Riverrun]].{{Ref|aGoT|62}} 

However, when word reaches Lord Tywins host of the defeat at the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] and of the capture of his nephew, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], he continued with the rest of the army to [[Harrenhal]]. Tywin orders Kevan to command [[Gregor Clegane]], [[Amory Lorch]] and [[Vargo Hoat]] leading their reavers in setting the [[Riverlands]] afire from the [[Gods Eye]] to the Red Fork while the rest of their host re-deploys at [[Harrenhal]].

===A Clash of Kings===
Kevan accompanies his brother's attempt to force his way into the [[Westerlands]] and took part in the [[Battle of the Fords]], he retreated with the army after the defeat at [[Stone Mill]] ford.{{Ref|aCoK|38}} Later he takes part in the attack on [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s flank during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

===A Storm of Swords===
After the [[Battle of the Blackwater|siege on King's Landing]] was lifted, King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] appointed Ser Kevan to his [[small council]] as [[Master of Laws]].{{Ref|aSoS|Appendix}} He also attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]], where he dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa.

He is present when news of the [[Red Wedding]] is received and was appalled by [[Joffrey Baratheon|King Joffreys]] statement that he wanted the head of [[Robb Stark]] so he could serve it to [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] at his own wedding (a request that Tywin refused to grant).

===A Feast for Crows===
Following the death of his brother, Tywin, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and she return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as unfit a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later, Cersei, out of spite, appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made [[Warden of the West]] and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brother's body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].{{Ref|aFfC|33}} After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.{{Ref|aFfC|43}}

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  As a concession to [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the [[small council]]: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. 
He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end.{{ref|aDwD|54}}

He discusses with the [[small council]] on how to deal with the crown's crisis of [[Jon Connington]] and his [[Aegon Targaryen|feigned dragon]] and the crown's financial problems. He later has supper with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Tommen I|King Tommen]].
Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}} He finds Pycelle dead in the Grand Maester's chambers. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

{{Quote|''&quot;...This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes...&quot;'' {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}}}

Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work; with his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe Kevan murdered by Tyrion or House Tyrell, who in turn will suspect her, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne, opening the way for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. Varys then commands two of his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}.

===Legacy===
Ser Kevan Lannister spent most of his life in his older brother's shadow. After [[Joanna Lannister]]'s death Kevan became Tywin's most trusted captain and confidant. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that... 

{{Quote|''&quot;...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot;''}} 

However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing. His leadership and diplomatic skills allowed him to placate [[House Tyrell]] after the damage Cersei did to the alliance with the House. Kevan also was in the process of binding the [[Faith of the Seven]] behind [[Tommen I]]. [[Varys]] knew Kevan could have succeeded in repairing the [[Iron Throne]]s Tyrell/Lannister alliance and making it a severe threat to [[Aegon Targaryen|Aegon VI]] claim, thus the reason Varys had Kevan killed.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

==Appearance and Character==

While it is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin didn’t have first, he is by no means stupid; he simply recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age. Kevan was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. He is known for his reliability and loyalty.

==History==
For years Kevan served as Tywin's most trusted captain.

However, when word reaches Lord Tywins host of the defeat at the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] and of the capture of his nephew, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], he continued with the rest of the army to [[Harrenhal]]. Tywin orders Kevan to command [[Gregor Clegane]], [[Amory Lorch]] and [[Vargo Hoat]] leading their reavers in setting the [[Riverlands]] afire from the [[Gods Eye]] to the Red Fork while the rest of their host re-deploys at [[Harrenhal]].

===A Storm of Swords===
After the [[Battle of the Blackwater|siege on King's Landing]] was lifted, King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] appointed Ser Kevan to his [[small council]] as [[Master of Laws]].{{Ref|aSoS|Appendix}} He also attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]], where he dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa.

He is present when news of the [[Red Wedding]] is received and was appalled by [[Joffrey Baratheon|King Joffreys]] statement that he wanted the head of [[Robb Stark]] so he could serve it to [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] at his own wedding (a request that Tywin refused to grant).

===A Feast for Crows===
Following the death of his brother, Tywin, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and she return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as unfit a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later, Cersei, out of spite, appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made [[Warden of the West]] and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brother's body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].{{Ref|aFfC|33}} After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.{{Ref|aFfC|43}}

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  As a concession to [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the [[small council]]: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. 
He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end.{{ref|aDwD|54}}

He discusses with the [[small council]] on how to deal with the crown's crisis of [[Jon Connington]] and his [[Aegon Targaryen|feigned dragon]] and the crown's financial problems. He later has supper with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Tommen I|King Tommen]].
Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}} He finds a white raven announcing winters arrival. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

{{Quote|''&quot;...This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes...&quot;'' {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}}}

Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work; with his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe Kevan murdered by Tyrion or House Tyrell, who in turn will suspect her, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne, opening the way for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. Varys then commands his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off. As he dies, he sees Pycelle dead at his desk, his head smashed in.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}

===Legacy===
Ser Kevan Lannister spent most of his life in his older brother's shadow. After [[Joanna Lannister]]'s death Kevan became Tywin's most trusted captain and confidant. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that... 

{{Quote|''&quot;...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot;''}} 

However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing. His leadership and diplomatic skills allowed him to placate [[House Tyrell]] after the damage Cersei did to the alliance with the House. Kevan also was in the process of binding the [[Faith of the Seven]] behind [[Tommen I]]. [[Varys]] knew Kevan could have succeeded in repairing the [[Iron Throne]]s Tyrell/Lannister alliance and making it a severe threat to [[Aegon Targaryen|Aegon VI]] claim, thus the reason Varys had Kevan killed.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

[[Varys]] knew Kevan could have succeeded in repairing the [[Iron Throne]]s Tyrell/Lannister alliance and making it a severe threat to [[Aegon Targaryen|Aegon's]] claim, thus the reason Varys had Kevan killed.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' was [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. In the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] he is played by Ian Gelder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingfaces.com/2009/09/game-of-thrones-cast-so-far/ Game of Thrones cast so far] on Liftingfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance and Character==
Ser Kevan is described as being a fat fifty five year old man, with rounded shoulders and fair skin.{{Ref|aFfC|7}} He is portly, balding, with close-cropped, yellow beard that follows the line of his massive jaw.{{Ref|aGoT|56}}

While it is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin didn’t have first, he is by no means stupid; he simply recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age. Kevan was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. He is known for his reliability and loyalty.

==History==
For years Kevan served as Tywin's most trusted captain. Kevan fought in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]]; his horse was terrifed of the red priest's flaming sword. He was described by his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth.

Kevan married [[Dorna Swyft]] and they have four children: [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], twin boys [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]] and [[Willem Lannister|Willem]], and a newborn daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

==Recent Events==
===A Game of Thrones===
[[File:Kevan Lannister.png|250px|thumb|Ian Gelder as Kevan Lannister ([[Game of Thrones|TV series]])]] 

Ser Kevan accompanies [[Tywin Lannister]] during his [[War of the Five Kings|campaign]] in [[the Riverlands]].{{Ref|aGoT|56}} At the [[Battle of the Green Fork]], he commands the center, a mixed force which is to wheel to support the left flank, should it break. Following their victory and discovery of [[Robb Stark]], they move to [[Riverrun]].{{Ref|aGoT|62}} 

However, when word reaches Lord Tywins host of the defeat at the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] and of the capture of his nephew, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], he continued with the rest of the army to [[Harrenhal]]. Tywin orders Kevan to command [[Gregor Clegane]], [[Amory Lorch]] and [[Vargo Hoat]] leading their reavers in setting the [[Riverlands]] afire from the [[Gods Eye]] to the Red Fork while the rest of their host re-deploys at [[Harrenhal]].

===A Clash of Kings===
Kevan accompanies his brother's attempt to force his way into the [[Westerlands]] and took part in the [[Battle of the Fords]], he retreated with the army after the defeat at [[Stone Mill]] ford.{{Ref|aCoK|38}} Later he takes part in the attack on [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s flank during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

===A Storm of Swords===
After the [[Battle of the Blackwater|siege on King's Landing]] was lifted, King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] appointed Ser Kevan to his [[small council]] as [[Master of Laws]].{{Ref|aSoS|Appendix}} He also attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]], where he dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa.

He is present when news of the [[Red Wedding]] is received and was appalled by [[Joffrey Baratheon|King Joffreys]] statement that he wanted the head of [[Robb Stark]] so he could serve it to [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] at his own wedding (a request that Tywin refused to grant).

===A Feast for Crows===
Following the death of his brother, Tywin, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and she return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as unfit a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later, Cersei, out of spite, appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made [[Warden of the West]] and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brother's body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].{{Ref|aFfC|33}} After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.{{Ref|aFfC|43}}

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  As a concession to [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the [[small council]]: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. 
He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end.{{ref|aDwD|54}}

He discusses with the [[small council]] on how to deal with the crown's crisis of [[Jon Connington]] and his [[Aegon Targaryen|feigned dragon]] and the crown's financial problems. He later has supper with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Tommen I|King Tommen]].
Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}} He finds a [[White raven]] announcing winters arrival. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

{{Quote|''&quot;...This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes...&quot;'' {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}}}

Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work; with his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe Kevan murdered by Tyrion or House Tyrell, who in turn will suspect her, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne, opening the way for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. Varys then commands his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off. As he dies, he sees Pycelle dead at his desk, his head smashed in.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}

===Legacy===
Ser Kevan Lannister spent most of his life in his older brother's shadow. After [[Joanna Lannister]]'s death Kevan became Tywin's most trusted captain and confidant. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that... 

{{Quote|''&quot;...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot;''}} 

However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing. His leadership and diplomatic skills allowed him to placate [[House Tyrell]] after the damage Cersei did to the alliance with the House.

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' was [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. In the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] he is played by Ian Gelder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingfaces.com/2009/09/game-of-thrones-cast-so-far/ Game of Thrones cast so far] on Liftingfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance and Character==
Ser Kevan is described as being a fat fifty five year old man, with rounded shoulders and fair skin.{{Ref|aFfC|7}} He is portly, balding, with close-cropped, yellow beard that follows the line of his massive jaw.{{Ref|aGoT|56}} See also [[:Category:Images of Kevan Lannister|this collection of images]].

While it is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin didn’t have first, he is by no means stupid; he simply recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age. Kevan was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. He is known for his reliability and loyalty.{{ref}}

==History==
For years Kevan served as Tywin's most trusted captain. Kevan fought in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]]; his horse was terrifed of the red priest's flaming sword. He was described by his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth.

Kevan married [[Dorna Swyft]] and they have four children: [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], twin boys [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]] and [[Willem Lannister|Willem]], and a newborn daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

==Recent Events==
===A Game of Thrones===
[[File:Kevan Lannister.png|250px|thumb|Ian Gelder as Kevan Lannister ([[Game of Thrones|TV series]])]] 

Ser Kevan accompanies [[Tywin Lannister]] during his [[War of the Five Kings|campaign]] in [[the Riverlands]].{{Ref|aGoT|56}} At the [[Battle of the Green Fork]], he commands the center, a mixed force which is to wheel to support the left flank, should it break. Following their victory and discovery of [[Robb Stark]], they move to [[Riverrun]].{{Ref|aGoT|62}} 

However, when word reaches Lord Tywins host of the defeat at the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] and of the capture of his nephew, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], he continued with the rest of the army to [[Harrenhal]]. Tywin orders Kevan to command [[Gregor Clegane]], [[Amory Lorch]] and [[Vargo Hoat]] leading their reavers in setting the [[Riverlands]] afire from the [[Gods Eye]] to the Red Fork while the rest of their host re-deploys at [[Harrenhal]].

===A Clash of Kings===
Kevan accompanies his brother's attempt to force his way into the [[Westerlands]] and took part in the [[Battle of the Fords]], he retreated with the army after the defeat at [[Stone Mill]] ford.{{Ref|aCoK|38}} Later he takes part in the attack on [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s flank during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

===A Storm of Swords===
After the [[Battle of the Blackwater|siege on King's Landing]] was lifted, King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] appointed Ser Kevan to his [[small council]] as [[Master of Laws]].{{Ref|aSoS|Appendix}} He also attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]], where he dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa.

He is present when news of the [[Red Wedding]] is received and was appalled by [[Joffrey Baratheon|King Joffreys]] statement that he wanted the head of [[Robb Stark]] so he could serve it to [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] at his own wedding (a request that Tywin refused to grant).

===A Feast for Crows===
Following the death of his brother, Tywin, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and she return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as unfit a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later, Cersei, out of spite, appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made [[Warden of the West]] and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brother's body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].{{Ref|aFfC|33}} After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.{{Ref|aFfC|43}}

===A Dance with Dragons===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  As a concession to [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the [[small council]]: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. 
He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end.{{ref|aDwD|54}}

He discusses with the [[small council]] on how to deal with the crown's crisis of [[Jon Connington]] and his [[Aegon Targaryen|feigned dragon]] and the crown's financial problems. He later has supper with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Tommen I|King Tommen]].
Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}} He finds a [[White raven]] announcing winters arrival. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

{{Quote|''&quot;...This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes...&quot;'' {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}}}

Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work; with his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe Kevan murdered by Tyrion or House Tyrell, who in turn will suspect her, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne, opening the way for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. Varys then commands his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off. As he dies, he sees Pycelle dead at his desk, his head smashed in.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}

===Legacy===
Ser Kevan Lannister spent most of his life in his older brother's shadow. After [[Joanna Lannister]]'s death Kevan became Tywin's most trusted captain and confidant. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that... 

{{Quote|''&quot;...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot;''}} 

However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing. His leadership and diplomatic skills allowed him to placate [[House Tyrell]] after the damage Cersei did to the alliance with the House. Kevan also was in the process of binding the [[Faith of the Seven]] behind [[Tommen I]]. [[Varys]] knew Kevan could have succeeded in repairing the [[Iron Throne]]s Tyrell/Lannister alliance and making it a severe threat to [[Aegon Targaryen|Aegon's]] claim, thus the reason Varys had Kevan killed.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

===''A Storm of Swords''===
After the [[Battle of the Blackwater|siege on King's Landing]] was lifted, King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] appointed Ser Kevan to his [[small council]] as [[Master of Laws]].{{Ref|aSoS|Appendix}} After receiving news of the death of his son Willem at [[Riverrun]], and with his other sons' lives in danger (Lancel's wound refuses to heal, and Martyn remains in Stark captivity), Kevan becomes consumed by worry and grief for a time; as a result Tywin must rely on Tyrion more than he would prefer.

Kevan attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]], where he dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa. He is present when news of the [[Red Wedding]] is received and was appalled by [[Joffrey Baratheon|King Joffrey's]] statement that he wanted the head of [[Robb Stark]] so he could serve it to [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] at his own wedding (a request that Tywin refused to grant).

Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].{{Ref|aFfC|33}} After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.{{Ref|aFfC|43}}

===''A Dance with Dragons''===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  As a concession to [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the [[small council]]: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. 
He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end.{{ref|aDwD|54}}

He discusses with the [[small council]] on how to deal with the crown's crisis of [[Jon Connington]] and his [[Aegon Targaryen|feigned dragon]] and the crown's financial problems. He later has supper with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Tommen I|King Tommen]].
Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}} He finds a [[White raven]] announcing winters arrival. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

{{Quote|''&quot;...This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes...&quot;'' {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}}}

Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work; with his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe Kevan murdered by Tyrion or House Tyrell, who in turn will suspect her, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne, opening the way for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. Varys then commands his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off. As he dies, he sees Pycelle dead at his desk, his head smashed in.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}

===Legacy===
Ser Kevan Lannister spent most of his life in his older brother's shadow. After [[Joanna Lannister]]'s death Kevan became Tywin's most trusted captain and confidant. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that... 

{{Quote|''&quot;...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot;''}} 

However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing. His leadership and diplomatic skills allowed him to placate [[House Tyrell]] after the damage Cersei did to the alliance with the House. Kevan also was in the process of binding the [[Faith of the Seven]] behind [[Tommen I]]. [[Varys]] knew Kevan could have succeeded in repairing the [[Iron Throne]]s Tyrell/Lannister alliance and making it a severe threat to [[Aegon Targaryen|Aegon's]] claim, thus the reason Varys had Kevan killed.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' was [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. In the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] he is played by Ian Gelder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingfaces.com/2009/09/game-of-thrones-cast-so-far/ Game of Thrones cast so far] on Liftingfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance &amp; Character==
Ser Kevan is described as being a fat fifty-five-year-old man, with rounded shoulders and fair skin.{{Ref|aFfC|7}} He is portly, balding, with short blond hair. He has a close-cropped, yellow beard that follows the line of his massive jaw.{{Ref|aGoT|56}}{{Ref|aDwD|54}} (See also [[:Category:Images of Kevan Lannister|this collection of images]].)

While it is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin didn’t have first, he is by no means stupid; he simply recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age. Kevan was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. He is known for his reliability and loyalty.{{ref}}

==History==
For years Kevan served as Tywin's most trusted captain. Kevan fought in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]]; his horse was terrified of the red priest's flaming sword. In 276 AL he may have been one of [[Cersei]]'s two uncles unhorsed by [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] in a [[History of Tourneys in Westeros|tourney]] held at [[Lannisport]]. He was described by his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth.

Kevan married [[Dorna Swyft]] and they have four children: [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], twin boys [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]] and [[Willem Lannister|Willem]], and a newborn daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

==Recent Events==
===''A Game of Thrones''===
[[File:Kevan Lannister.png|250px|thumb|Ian Gelder as Kevan Lannister ([[Game of Thrones|TV series]])]] 

Ser Kevan accompanies [[Tywin Lannister]] during his [[War of the Five Kings#War_in_the_Riverlands|campaign in the Riverlands]].{{Ref|aGoT|56}} At the [[Battle of the Green Fork]], he commands the center, a large mixed force. Tywin intends the left flank to break and for Kevan to wheel around to crush the advancing northmen against the river, however the cautious northern general [[Roose Bolton]] withdraws rather than fall into this trap. Following their victory, the Lannisters discover that [[Robb Stark]] was not present in the battle, and they move toward [[Riverrun]].{{Ref|aGoT|62}} 

However, when word reaches Lord Tywin's host of the defeat at the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] and of the capture of his nephew, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], he continued with the rest of the army to [[Harrenhal]]. Tywin orders Kevan to command [[Gregor Clegane]], [[Amory Lorch]] and [[Vargo Hoat]] to lead their reavers in setting the [[Riverlands]] afire from the [[Gods Eye]] to the Red Fork while the rest of their host re-deploys at [[Harrenhal]].

===''A Clash of Kings''===
Kevan accompanies his brother's attempt to force his way into the [[Westerlands]] and took part in the [[Battle of the Fords]], he retreated with the army after the defeat at [[Stone Mill]] ford.{{Ref|aCoK|38}} Later he takes part in the attack on [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s flank during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

===''A Storm of Swords''===
After the [[Battle of the Blackwater|siege on King's Landing]] was lifted, King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] appointed Ser Kevan to his [[small council]] as [[Master of Laws]].{{Ref|aSoS|Appendix}} After receiving news of the death of his son Willem at [[Riverrun]], and with his other sons' lives in danger (Lancel's wound refuses to heal, and Martyn remains in Stark captivity), Kevan becomes consumed by worry and grief for a time; as a result Tywin must rely on Tyrion more than he would prefer.

Kevan attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]], where he dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa. He is present when news of the [[Red Wedding]] is received and was appalled by [[Joffrey Baratheon|King Joffrey's]] statement that he wanted the head of [[Robb Stark]] so he could serve it to [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] at his own wedding (a request that Tywin refused to grant).

===''A Feast for Crows''===
Following the death of his brother, Tywin, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and she return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as unfit a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later, Cersei, out of spite, appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made [[Warden of the West]] and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brother's body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].{{Ref|aFfC|33}} After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.{{Ref|aFfC|43}}

Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}} He finds a [[White raven]] announcing winters arrival. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' was [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. In the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] he is played by Ian Gelder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingfaces.com/2009/09/game-of-thrones-cast-so-far/ Game of Thrones cast so far] on Liftingfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance &amp; Character==
Ser Kevan is described as being a fat fifty-five-year-old man, with rounded shoulders and fair skin.{{Ref|aFfC|7}} He is portly, balding, with short blond hair. He has a close-cropped, yellow beard that follows the line of his massive jaw.{{Ref|aGoT|56}}{{Ref|aDwD|54}} (See also [[:Category:Images of Kevan Lannister|this collection of images]].)

While it is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin didn’t have first, he is by no means stupid; he simply recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age. Kevan was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. He is known for his reliability and loyalty.{{ref}}

==History==
For years Kevan served as Tywin's most trusted captain. Kevan fought in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]]; his horse was terrified of the red priest's flaming sword. In 276 AL he may have been one of [[Cersei]]'s two uncles unhorsed by [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] in a [[History of Tourneys in Westeros|tourney]] held at [[Lannisport]]. He was described by his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth.

Kevan married [[Dorna Swyft]] and they have four children: [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], twin boys [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]] and [[Willem Lannister|Willem]], and a newborn daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

==Recent Events==
===''A Game of Thrones''===
[[File:Kevan Lannister.png|250px|thumb|Ian Gelder as Kevan Lannister ([[Game of Thrones|TV series]])]] 

Ser Kevan accompanies [[Tywin Lannister]] during his [[War of the Five Kings#War_in_the_Riverlands|campaign in the Riverlands]].{{Ref|aGoT|56}} At the [[Battle of the Green Fork]], he commands the center, a large mixed force. Tywin intends the left flank to break and for Kevan to wheel around to crush the advancing northmen against the river, however the cautious northern general [[Roose Bolton]] withdraws rather than fall into this trap. Following their victory, the Lannisters discover that [[Robb Stark]] was not present in the battle, and they move toward [[Riverrun]].{{Ref|aGoT|62}} 

However, when word reaches Lord Tywin's host of the defeat at the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] and of the capture of his nephew, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], he continued with the rest of the army to [[Harrenhal]]. Tywin orders Kevan to command [[Gregor Clegane]], [[Amory Lorch]] and [[Vargo Hoat]] to lead their reavers in setting the [[Riverlands]] afire from the [[Gods Eye]] to the Red Fork while the rest of their host re-deploys at [[Harrenhal]].

===''A Clash of Kings''===
Kevan accompanies his brother's attempt to force his way into the [[Westerlands]] and took part in the [[Battle of the Fords]], he retreated with the army after the defeat at [[Stone Mill]] ford.{{Ref|aCoK|38}} Later he takes part in the attack on [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s flank during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

===''A Storm of Swords''===
After the [[Battle of the Blackwater|siege on King's Landing]] was lifted, King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] appointed Ser Kevan to his [[small council]] as [[Master of Laws]].{{Ref|aSoS|Appendix}} After receiving news of the death of his son Willem at [[Riverrun]], and with his other sons' lives in danger (Lancel's wound refuses to heal, and Martyn remains in Stark captivity), Kevan becomes consumed by worry and grief for a time; as a result Tywin must rely on Tyrion more than he would prefer.

Kevan attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]], where he dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa. He is present when news of the [[Red Wedding]] is received and was appalled by [[Joffrey Baratheon|King Joffrey's]] statement that he wanted the head of [[Robb Stark]] so he could serve it to [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] at his own wedding (a request that Tywin refused to grant).

===''A Feast for Crows''===
Following the death of his brother, Tywin, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and she return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as unfit a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later, Cersei, out of spite, appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made [[Warden of the West]] and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brother's body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].{{Ref|aFfC|33}} After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.{{Ref|aFfC|43}}

===''A Dance with Dragons''===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  As a concession to [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the [[small council]]: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. 
He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end.{{ref|aDwD|54}}

He discusses with the [[small council]] on how to deal with the crown's crisis of [[Jon Connington]] and his [[Aegon Targaryen|feigned dragon]] and the crown's financial problems. He later has supper with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Tommen I|King Tommen]].
Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}} He finds a [[White raven]] announcing winters arrival. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

{{Quote|''&quot;...This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes...&quot;'' {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}}}

Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work; with his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe Kevan murdered by Tyrion or House Tyrell, who in turn will suspect her, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne, opening the way for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. Varys then commands his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off. As he dies, he sees Pycelle dead at his desk, his head smashed in.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}

==Life==
Ser Kevan Lannister spent most of his life in his older brother's shadow. After [[Joanna Lannister]]'s death Kevan became Tywin's most trusted captain and confidant. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that... 

{{Quote|''&quot;...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot;''}} 

However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing. His leadership and diplomatic skills allowed him to placate [[House Tyrell]] after the damage Cersei did to the alliance with the House. Kevan also was in the process of binding the [[Faith of the Seven]] behind [[Tommen I]]. [[Varys]] knew Kevan could have succeeded in repairing the [[Iron Throne]]s Tyrell/Lannister alliance and making it a severe threat to [[Aegon Targaryen|Aegon's]] claim, thus the reason Varys had Kevan killed.

==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

Kevan married [[Dorna Swyft]] and they have four children: [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], twin boys [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]] and [[Willem Lannister|Willem]], and a newborn daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

[[File:Kevan Lannister.png|250px|thumb|Ian Gelder as Kevan Lannister ([[Game of Thrones|TV series]])]] 

Ser Kevan accompanies [[Tywin Lannister]] during his [[War of the Five Kings#War_in_the_Riverlands|campaign in the Riverlands]].{{Ref|aGoT|56}} At the [[Battle of the Green Fork]], he commands the center, a large mixed force. Tywin intends the left flank to break and for Kevan to wheel around to crush the advancing northmen against the river, however the cautious northern general [[Roose Bolton]] withdraws rather than fall into this trap. Following their victory, the Lannisters discover that [[Robb Stark]] was not present in the battle, and they move toward [[Riverrun]].{{Ref|aGoT|62}} 

However, when word reaches Lord Tywin's host of the defeat at the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] and of the capture of his nephew, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], he continued with the rest of the army to [[Harrenhal]]. Tywin orders Kevan to command [[Gregor Clegane]], [[Amory Lorch]] and [[Vargo Hoat]] to lead their reavers in setting the [[Riverlands]] afire from the [[Gods Eye]] to the Red Fork while the rest of their host re-deploys at [[Harrenhal]].

===''A Clash of Kings''===
Kevan accompanies his brother's attempt to force his way into the [[Westerlands]] and took part in the [[Battle of the Fords]], he retreated with the army after the defeat at [[Stone Mill]] ford.{{Ref|aCoK|38}} Later he takes part in the attack on [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s flank during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

===''A Storm of Swords''===
After the [[Battle of the Blackwater|siege on King's Landing]] was lifted, King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] appointed Ser Kevan to his [[small council]] as [[Master of Laws]].{{Ref|aSoS|Appendix}} After receiving news of the death of his son Willem at [[Riverrun]], and with his other sons' lives in danger (Lancel's wound refuses to heal, and Martyn remains in Stark captivity), Kevan becomes consumed by worry and grief for a time; as a result Tywin must rely on Tyrion more than he would prefer.

Kevan attends the wedding of [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]], where he dances with several ladies at the feast, including Sansa. He is present when news of the [[Red Wedding]] is received and was appalled by [[Joffrey Baratheon|King Joffrey's]] statement that he wanted the head of [[Robb Stark]] so he could serve it to [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] at his own wedding (a request that Tywin refused to grant).

===''A Feast for Crows''===
Following the death of his brother, Tywin, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] offers him the position of [[Hand of the King]]. Kevan has serious doubts about Cersei's leadership, and states that he will only accept the position if Cersei names him [[Regent]] as well as Hand and she return to [[Casterly Rock]]. She refuses, however, and Kevan then refuses the office of Hand. He tells Cersei that, from what he saw of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], she is as unfit a mother as she is a ruler, causing an enraged Cersei to throw her wine in his face. Later, Cersei, out of spite, appoints two Lannister cousins in positions that Kevan was better suited for; [[Daven Lannister|Daven]] was made [[Warden of the West]] and [[Damion Lannister|Damion]] was named Castellan of [[Casterly Rock]]. 

Kevan rides at the head of the escort that is to return his brother's body to the west to be buried in [[Casterly Rock]]. Kevan quickly becomes alienated from his immediate family and comes to believe [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be Joffrey's murderer. He also comes to believe the rumors of incest between Cersei and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. His eldest son, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], becomes a religious fanatic and abandons [[House Darry|Castle Darry]], the estate Kevan had won for him. Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].{{Ref|aFfC|33}} After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.{{Ref|aFfC|43}}

===''A Dance with Dragons''===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  As a concession to [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the [[small council]]: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. 
He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end.{{ref|aDwD|54}}

He discusses with the [[small council]] on how to deal with the crown's crisis of [[Jon Connington]] and his [[Aegon Targaryen|feigned dragon]] and the crown's financial problems. He later has supper with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Tommen I|King Tommen]].
Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}} He finds a [[White raven]] announcing winters arrival. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

{{Quote|''&quot;...This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes...&quot;'' {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}}}

Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work; with his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe Kevan murdered by Tyrion or House Tyrell, who in turn will suspect her, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne, opening the way for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. Varys then commands his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off. As he dies, he sees Pycelle dead at his desk, his head smashed in.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}

==Life==
Ser Kevan Lannister spent most of his life in his older brother's shadow. After [[Joanna Lannister]]'s death Kevan became Tywin's most trusted captain and confidant. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that... 

{{Quote|''&quot;...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.&quot;''}} 

However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing. His leadership and diplomatic skills allowed him to placate [[House Tyrell]] after the damage Cersei did to the alliance with the House. Kevan also was in the process of binding the [[Faith of the Seven]] behind [[Tommen I]]. [[Varys]] knew Kevan could have succeeded in repairing the [[Iron Throne]]s Tyrell/Lannister alliance and making it a severe threat to [[Aegon Targaryen|Aegon's]] claim, thus the reason Varys had Kevan killed.

==Quotes by Kevan==

{{Quote|A man who fights for coin is loyal only to his purse. {{ref|agot|69}}}}


==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

Ser '''Kevan Lannister''' was [[Tywin Lannister]]'s younger brother. In the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] he is played by Ian Gelder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liftingfaces.com/2009/09/game-of-thrones-cast-so-far/ Game of Thrones cast so far] on Liftingfaces&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance &amp; Character==
Ser Kevan is described as being a fat fifty-five-year-old man, with rounded shoulders and fair skin.{{Ref|aFfC|7}} He is portly, balding, with short blond hair. He has a close-cropped, yellow beard that follows the line of his massive jaw.{{Ref|aGoT|56}}{{Ref|aDwD|54}} (See also [[:Category:Images of Kevan Lannister|this collection of images]].)

While it is said that Kevan never had a thought that Tywin didn’t have first, he is by no means stupid; he simply recognized the superiority of his brother at an early age. Kevan was comfortable doing his duty to realize his brother's wishes, though this meant perpetually living in his shadow. He is known for his reliability and loyalty.{{ref}}

==History==
For years Kevan served as Tywin's most trusted captain. Kevan fought in a melee once at [[King's Landing]] but was thrown from his horse by [[Thoros of Myr]]; his horse was terrified of the red priest's flaming sword. In 276 AL he may have been one of [[Cersei]]'s two uncles unhorsed by [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] in a [[History of Tourneys in Westeros|tourney]] held at [[Lannisport]]. He was described by his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] as being a stout man with a sword in his youth.

Kevan married [[Dorna Swyft]] and they have four children: [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], twin boys [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]] and [[Willem Lannister|Willem]], and a newborn daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].

Kevan is also angered that [[Daven Lannister]] receives the title of [[Warden of the West]] over him, though he bears Daven no ill will as he knows Daven never asked for the position. 

He refuses to add his forces to his cousin's at [[Riverrun]], and returns to the west to see his younger son [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]].{{Ref|aFfC|33}} After Cersei's imprisonment, the [[small council]] led by Grandmaester [[Pycelle]] and [[Harys Swyft]] the Master of Coin name Kevan [[Regent|Regent of the King]] and send a raven to Casterly Rock offering him the position.{{Ref|aFfC|43}}

===''A Dance with Dragons''===
Kevan accepts the role of [[Regent]] to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and  sets about trying to fix the mess that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] made.  As a concession to [[House Tyrell]], Kevan makes [[Mace Tyrell]] [[Hand of the King]] and raises two of Tyrell's bannerman to the [[small council]]: [[Paxter Redwyne]] is made the [[Master of Ships]], and Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] the [[Master of Laws]]. 
He visits the imprisoned Cersei and confronts her about her affair with his son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. He tells her that regardless of the outcome of her trial, her rule is now at an end.{{ref|aDwD|54}}

He discusses with the [[small council]] on how to deal with the crown's crisis of [[Jon Connington]] and his [[Aegon Targaryen|feigned dragon]] and the crown's financial problems. He later has supper with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Tommen I|King Tommen]].
Ser Kevan is told by a servant that [[Pycelle|Grand Maester Pycelle]] is seeking him.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}} He finds a [[White raven]] announcing winters arrival. [[Varys]] appears suddenly and shoots Kevan in the chest with a crossbow. Varys apologizes to Kevan as he lays dying, stating that he bears Kevan no ill will...

{{Quote|''...This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes...'' {{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}}}

Varys tells him he cannot allow Kevan to undo Cersei's work; with his death by crossbow, Cersei will believe Kevan murdered by Tyrion or House Tyrell, who in turn will suspect her, undermining the alliances shoring up Tommen's hold on the Iron Throne, opening the way for [[Aegon Targaryen|King Aegon VI]]. Varys then commands his &quot;little birds&quot; to finish Kevan off. As he dies, he sees Pycelle dead at his desk, his head smashed in.{{Ref|aDwD|Epilogue}}

==Life==
Ser Kevan Lannister spent most of his life in his older brother's shadow. After [[Joanna Lannister]]'s death Kevan became Tywin's most trusted captain and confidant. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] once says of Kevan that... 

{{Quote|''...the gods shaped him to be a follower not a leader, well the gods and my lord father.''}} 

However, in his few appearances after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s death, Kevan proved himself an able and competent leader in his own right. Despite not being a Lord, his strategic thinking, significant retinue and personal wealth made him a man of significant standing. His leadership and diplomatic skills allowed him to placate [[House Tyrell]] after the damage Cersei did to the alliance with the House. Kevan also was in the process of binding the [[Faith of the Seven]] behind [[Tommen I]]. [[Varys]] knew Kevan could have succeeded in repairing the [[Iron Throne]]s Tyrell/Lannister alliance and making it a severe threat to [[Aegon Targaryen|Aegon's]] claim, thus the reason Varys had Kevan killed.

==Quotes by Kevan==

{{Quote|A man who fights for coin is loyal only to his purse. {{ref|agot|69}}}}


==Family==
Kevan Lannister is married to Dorna of [[House Swyft]], with whom he has three sons, [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], and a daughter, [[Janei Lannister|Janei]].
